# My graphic 3D engine

I became interested in visualization geometric 3D primitives. So I wrote this small project to practice this theme. 

Program uses CPU for all calculations so it is very slow. May be I will write GPU render in future

## Possibilities

The one object, engine can draw, is ellipsoid (of course circle is easier to calculate, but ellipsoid much more interesting to transform).

## Examples of render
